Sensor Fault Detection High-Level Code Flow
This document outlines the high-level code flow for the Sensor Fault Detection system.

System Architecture
The Sensor Fault Detection system consists of the following components:

Data Ingestion Component: Responsible for ingesting data from sensors and storing it in a feature store.
Data Validation Component: Validates the ingested data for consistency and quality.
Data Transformation Component: Transforms the ingested data into a suitable format for training the model.
Model Trainer Component: Trains a machine learning model to detect sensor faults.
Model Evaluation Component: Evaluates the performance of the trained model.
Model Pusher Component: Pushes the trained model to the production environment.
Code Flow
The code flow for the Sensor Fault Detection system is as follows:

Data Ingestion:

The Data Ingestion Component receives data from sensors and stores it in a MongoDB database.
The data is then exported to a feature store.
The feature store contains the data in a format that is suitable for training the model.
Data Validation:

The Data Validation Component validates the data in the feature store for consistency and quality.
This includes checking for missing data, duplicate data, and other anomalies.
If any validation errors are found, the system raises an alert and the data is not processed further.
Data Transformation:

The Data Transformation Component transforms the validated data into a format that is suitable for training the model.
This may involve scaling the data, removing outliers, or encoding categorical features.
Model Training:

The Model Trainer Component trains a machine learning model on the transformed data.
The model is trained to detect sensor faults based on the historical data.
Model Evaluation:

The Model Evaluation Component evaluates the performance of the trained model.
This involves measuring the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
If the model's performance is not satisfactory, the system may go back to step 4 and re-train the model with different parameters or data.
Model Pushing:

If the model's performance is satisfactory, the Model Pusher Component pushes the model to the production environment.
This makes the model available for use in real-time fault detection ## README for Sensor Fault Detection System
Overview
The Sensor Fault Detection system is designed to monitor sensor data and detect faults in real-time. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, code flow, and data ingestion pipeline.

System Architecture
The architecture consists of the following components:

Data Ingestion Component: Ingests data from sensors and stores it in a feature store.
Data Validation Component: Validates the ingested data for consistency and quality.
Data Transformation Component: Transforms the ingested data into a suitable format for training the model.
Model Trainer Component: Trains a machine learning model to detect sensor faults.
Model Evaluation Component: Evaluates the performance of the trained model.
Model Pusher Component: Pushes the trained model to the production environment.
Data Ingestion Pipeline
The data ingestion pipeline is crucial for processing data and preparing it for analysis. The steps involved are:

Data Ingestion Configuration:

Define the data ingestion configuration, including paths for raw data, processed features, training, and testing data.
Initiate Data Ingestion:

Begin the ingestion process by reading raw data from the specified directory.
Export Data to Feature Store:

Extract relevant data, clean and transform it, and save it to a feature store.
Data Ingestion Artifact:

Create an artifact capturing details of the ingestion process, including timestamps and metadata.
Drop Columns:

Remove unnecessary columns from the dataset.
Split Data as Train and Test:

Split the data into training and testing sets based on a predefined ratio.
Feature Store:

Store processed features in a central repository for easy access.
Ingested:

Store the processed and split data in the ingested directory.
Output Files:

Output processed data in CSV format, including sensor.csv containing all processed features.
Code Flow
The code flow for the Sensor Fault Detection system is as follows:

Data Ingestion:

Receive data from sensors and store it in a MongoDB database, then export it to a feature store.
Data Validation:

Validate the data for consistency and quality, checking for missing or duplicate data.
Data Transformation:

Transform validated data into a suitable format for model training.
Model Training:

Train a machine learning model on the transformed data to detect sensor faults.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Model Pushing:

Push the trained model to the production environment if performance is satisfactory.
